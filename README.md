This mini project was just to prove the central limit theorem naively without the formal approach.
It is done by doing a little simmulations.
The non parametric kernel density estimation was used for the samples and populations to estimate the distributions.
This is to provide upcoming statisticians a naive proof of the central limit theorem when all the underlying assumptions are upheld.
